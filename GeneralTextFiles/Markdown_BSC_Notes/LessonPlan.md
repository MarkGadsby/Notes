### Lesson plan notes

 ##### Prior knowledge
 - using scratch
 - decomposition
 - sequence & selection
   - getting dressed, on which day
 - repetition
   - tidy items from floor - repeat till clear
 - variables
   - to keep score in game
 - devices
   - tablets
   - phones
   - traffic lights
   - CCTV - movement sensors
   - School bus - engine management

##### Supporting progress
- Moving to text based language - python

##### Challenging the able
- Use an input variable to set the number of sides of the polygon
- Put drawing code into a procedure
- Use nested loops to create repeating patterns

##### Supporting lower ability  
- Move from sequence of instructions for square to rectangle to triangle
- Experiment with pen size, background, shape fill colours

##### Objective
- Everyone
  - Be able to draw a colour shape on coloured background using turtle graphics in python
- Most
  - Be able to introduce a 'while' loop
- Some
  - Introduce a variable to set the number of sides of the polygon
- Stretch goal
  - Get user input to set the number of sides of the polygon and/or use nested loops to draw repeating patterns of the polygon.

##### Be able to explain
- The steps involved in drawing a square on the computer screen in way the computer can understand

##### Summery
 - We have used the python programming language and turtle graphics
 - We have broken a task down to simple steps
 - We have used a loop to to repeat those steps
 - We have set the colours of the background, the shape outline and coloured the shape in

##### Next time
 - We will use a program called Sonic Pi to see how we can break music into sequences and loops to make tunes like this - Demo
 - If you are interested in developing your turtle graphics skills come to Creative Computing after school Club and learn how we can use the skills we are learning to create animations like this one - Demo

##### From Slides:
 - Lesson objectives
   - practical - see above
   - macro - Probably at the start of year 7, so need to ascertain level of experience within the class
   - pique interest in the potential of programming for fun and creatitivity.
