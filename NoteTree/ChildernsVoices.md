###### The State of voices: [Voice 21](https://voice21.org/)

##### Speak like a computer scientist - model the talk you expect from pupils.

We use 2000 words of our 50,000 - Matthew 13:12: 

*Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.*

Keep to the technical terms but stop and explain as they come up.
