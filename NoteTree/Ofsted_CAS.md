### John Nixon - Ofsted

## Computing as a deep dive.

##### Quality of curriculum
- Ambitious
- Coherently Planned
- Adapted, designed and developed 
- *a curriculum that is broad and rich fro all pupils* 

##### How do you use assessment?

##### How do you check all pupils are learning the curriculum?

##### How do you ensure pupils get their full entitlement to computing as defined within the national curriculum?
- How do ensure all are digitally literate?

##### Is pupils' performance used to asses content and sequencing?

### Curriculum **intention**

##### Sequenced curriculum constantly turned over - or block learning? What ever works. 
- What can they do now that they could not do before?

##### Scrutiny of pupils' work
- Not always in books

- Can be on shared drive

- In portfolio

##### Is the curriculum effective and appropriate?
 
### NB:

- Content of a schools curriculum should be on their web-site
- Won't look at in-year data.
- Need to take file saving seriously - build full folder tree and fill as students go.
