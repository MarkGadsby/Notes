# An investigation of pupil progress and assessment in computing

A 3,500-word essay in which you reflect upon and investigate pupil progress and assessment in computing.

**Select an aspect of assessment** (e.g. peer assessment; feedback; programming projects; Project Euler style problems; multiple choice items; Parsons’ problems) in school and critically review the academic research and professional literature on this topic.

Using the literature, **plan a sequence of four to six lessons** which uses this form of assessment to **promote pupil progress**.

### Introduction (500)

The aspect of assessment I have selected for this assignment is programming projects. I am convinced that it is through programming computers that a deep understanding of the power and potential of computers  can be archived. It is an activity that can in itself be highly motivating and rewarding for students. It is this practical element of computing that ties our subject to other creative subjects taught like art & design, design & technology and music. It is recognised that developing a young persons critical judgement, imagination and intuition though the type of experimentation and perseverance that computer programming can instil will not only enhance an individuals chances of economic success but also contribute positively to their health and well-being and help them develop a healthy relationship with their community (Newton, 2019).  Thanks to the persuasive powers of the British Computer Society, computing has the advantage over the other subjects in the creative sphere in that it has been included in the English Baccalaureate. It may well be that it's through our subject that pupils are garnered a rare opportunity to express their hard won theoretical knowledge in a creative practical manner. 



Programming project tasks need to be authentic, have scope for creativity and be of interest to young people.  



To think about problems in a way that makes them suitable for a computer to help solve.

### Teaching (500)

The teachers role when supervising a programming project to act as a sounding board very much more  'guide by the side’ than ‘sage on the stage’.

Because object-orientation was being introduced as an entirely new topic, not just in the context of the A level course currently being taught but also for the totality of the cohort being taught. Questioning revealed that none of the students had encountered object-orientation at all during their prior learning. This meant that some theory required. It was my 



### Evaluation (500)

The role of the teacher is to facilitate the making of connections in our students minds or to reinforce those, that were perhaps made in a different context, already there. The role of evaluation is to try to ascertain how well we have achieved our goal by changing what happens in a students mind. 



Core to my previous role, which was working in industry employed as a software engineer, was the job of getting software systems working or improving their performance. I can see parallels with my new chosen career as a teacher of computer science, for it is equally important to ensure that my pupils do make real progress and that we can measure it.

Miles talks about how in science the practical element has been removed but has been replaced by a series of practical task that need to be completed and may be referred to in the summative assessment end of course exam, but do not count towards the final grade in themselves. In computing, rather then the set programming project, we could set tasks that require the application of a computing principle that may then be referred to in the exam rather than by assessed directly.  

John Nixon from OFSTED, speaking at this years CAS summer conference, was clear that when scrutinising pupils' work, during a school inspection, they did not expect to see everything recorded in students exercise books and were happy to see completed project work on a shared drive or in a students on-line portfolio. This approach ties in very nicely with a set of solved programming projects which can be catalogued appropriately for an individual student.  

Miles bemoans the removal by Ofqual from the marked content of the computer science GCSE of the practical programming project. A situation made more unsatisfactory by Ofqual's insistence on 20 hours of lesson time being dedicated to the project, despite it not being directly assessed. He goes on to praise the amount of practical programming in the A Level and real breath and flexibility of the range of topic allowed.

The national curriculum for computing aims to ensure that all pupils:

- can analyse problems in computational terms, and have repeated  practical experience of writing computer programs in order to solve such problems

If you are going to settle on one language and go for depth rather then breath, let that be 'C' as it sit close to the machine and clearly represents the fundamental principles of computing.
