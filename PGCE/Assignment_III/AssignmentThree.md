# Can teaching strategies help children with dyslexia learn computer programming?

During my placements I noticed that students with dyslexia are prone to becoming disengaged from the lesson content. Yet, those same students were among the strongest computer programmers in the class. I find this a fascinating dichotomy and have chosen to complete an investigation into the barriers faced by students with dyslexia when learning computer programming. 

## Introduction

People with dyslexia are over-represented in the field of software engineering (Stein, 2018). There is a growing body of evidence that they excel at creative problem solving and at being able to visualise complex systems holistically. It would seem that software development is a field in which dyslexia confers advantages that override the problems dyslexics commonly have with reading, spelling and short term memory. It is my proposal that by employing practical, holistic and visual teaching strategies, computing educators can play to the strengths of the dyslexic mind. This is in contrast to traditional methods of teaching and assessment that tend to exemplify the weaknesses. By tapping into the innate capacities of children with dyslexia in this way will help them to appreciate the valuable contribution they have to make in the computing classroom and thus building confidence, resilience and positive engagement. 

## An overview of dyslexia 

Most people have some idea what it means to be dyslexic, they are aware that it affects some famous successful people and that it can confer difficulties with reading, spelling and writing whereby letters and numbers are jumbled and misrepresented, such as confusing the number 9 with the letter P. It is sometimes referred to as word blindness and generally considered in terms of being a learning difficulty or learning disability. 

This deficit-centric view is incompatible with the accumulated evidence about the strengths that also come with dyslexic processing. If viewed from an alternative perspective it could be categorised as less of a disabliltiy and more as an alternative way of negotiating the world. 

Dyslexia affects at least 7.5% of the population (Shaywitz *at al.*, 1990) and some experts in the field think that proportion could be as high as 20%. Prof. John Stein of Magdalen College, Oxford (2018), suggests that, given that the differences in brain function have a genetic root, they must confer an advantage to our species in order have survived the process of natural selection.

## How Dyslexic brains are different 

#### Phonological deficit

Over the last thirty years the prevailing view has been established that the symptoms of dyslexia are due to deficiencies in processing phonics. Phonics arable pull a lot of the theory in this area together by beinge a set of forty-five or so sounds that patterns of letters make to produce the English language. Just as the letters themselves make up the alphabet, the phonics they produce make up all the sounds required for language. Problems with matching word sounds to letters would make writing and spelling more challenging; similar difficulties decoding the sounds that letter patterns make would render reading harder. Phonological problems occur at such a fundamental level you would expect them to affect higher level functions as well, and the traits dyslexics display, of jumbling sentences and inaccurate grammar, would seem to illustrate this theory. This probably goes some way to explaining the nature of dyslexia but sheds little light on the underlying causes. Moreover, other characteristics commonly found in people with dyslexia do not have a ready mapping onto phonological processing. Dyslexic people often have trouble with finger coordination, which expresses itself as difficulties with handwriting, and Eden *et al.*, (1994) have shown that many dyslexics lack eye movement control when reading.

#### Cerebellar dysfunction

Coordination skills are motor skills which are controlled by the cerebellum, a small structure to the back and bottom of the brain, densely packed with neurons. Nicolson *et al.*, (2001) proposed that dyslexia could be caused by dysfunction in cerebellar performance which is then manifested in problems developing both phonological and motor skills. The cerebellum has been traditionally understood to be important for learning and retaining automatic tasks, such as knitting, and Nicolson *et al.* were able to correlate impairment in acquiring automatic and procedural type skills with people who are dyslexic.

The debate sparked by these findings coalesced around the ideas that literacy skills may well require the co-ordination of several areas of the brain, particularly those concerned with motor, visual and cognitive activities. A clear understanding of the causes of dyslexia has the potential to confer insight into the functioning of the brain far beyond the condition itself, and it remains a field of active research. 

#### Right brained thinking style

It is not the case, however, that all people with dyslexia also have impaired procedural learning, so a deeper, more fundamental understanding of how the brain processes information would seem to be required. In 1981 Dr. Roger Sperry won the Nobel prize for his work identifying that the brain's left and right hemispheres each had different specialities. The idea that the left hemisphere is used for close focus and fine detail processing, whilst the right hemisphere specialises in processing visual images, spatial relationships and pattern recognition, has entered the common discourse. This type of shorthand oversimplification is not always helpful but the development of functional magnetic resonance imaging a decade later allowed scientists to prove that people with dyslexia significantly favour the right hemisphere when reading, particularly the frontal parts of the brain which are used for strategic thinking  (Shaywitz *et al.*, 1998). 

Mark Jung-Beeman was able to explore further and he concluded that language is processed mostly in the left hemisphere but that when the comprehension of complex language constructs, such as metaphor, is required the right hemisphere plays an important role (Jung-Beeman, 2005). Further work by Turkeltaub *el al.*, (2003) established that all novice readers utilise both sides of the brain, with the majority becoming increasingly reliant on the left hemisphere as their skill developed. People with dyslexia, however, process information predominately in the right hemisphere and this could explain why their deficiencies in literacy are often accompanied with enhanced skills typically associated with the right hemisphere thinking such as inventiveness, inferential reasoning and multidimensional thinking (Davis & Braun, 2011). 

Support for this theory can found throughout the literature (West, 1997; Von Karolyi *et al.*, 2003; Eide & Eide, 2012), the proposal being that people with dyslexia can have enhanced visualisation, 3-D spatial awareness, lateral thinking and overall creativity. There are many examples of the prominent individuals who have struggled with basic language and arithmetic skills yet display visionary creativity. These differences in thought processing are important to understand if we are to realise the potential of individuals to develop the innovation and creativity increasingly required for high value jobs in the workplace of the future.

These ideas are further verified by the unattainability of a cure for dyslexia. Even dyslexics who have effectively overcome their condition to function at a level of literacy skill commensurate with their potential continue to read more slowly and need to regularly reaffirm the correct spelling of certain words as they write. This lends more weight to the theory that we are primarily dealing with a separate method of thought processing.

#### Minicolumn spacing

The eminent neurologist Dr Manuel F. Casanova has suggested that the arrangement of neurons in the cortex of the brain could explain the differences in dyslexic brains and, fascinatingly, also those of people with autism. The cortex is thin layer of cells that covers the whole of the brain; within the cortex are found columns of neurons clustered together called minicolumns. Minicolumns are responsible for particular elements of information processing and groups of minicolumns are interconnected via axons to collectively perform higher level processing functions. What Casanova found was that the spacing between the minicolumns in the cortex varies between individuals, with the distribution in the population forming a bell curve. He found a correlation to dyslexia at one end of the distribution, and to autism at the other (Williams & Casanova, 2010).

At the tightly packed end, seen in people with autism, connections between the minicolumns are short and therefore effective at performing specialised fine-detail processing and quickly recognising small differences within a flow of information. The other end of the scale, where we find the longer connections between the minicolumns, correlated with the broad, holistic, big picture thinking style that dyslexics intuitively employ. Dr Casanova underlines the ramifications of his findings by saying that more widely spaced minicolumns could account for the deficit in phonological processing that is the most prevalent symptom of dyslexia.

## Strategies to help students with dyslexia to make progress in the computing classroom.

Having become acquainted with the current theory on the causes and effects of dyslexia the all important question of how this can inform classroom practice comes to the fore. My classroom observations revealed that teaching style employed seemed to make a significant difference to the engagement, or otherwise, of pupils with dyslexia. Lessons based heavily on theory which conveyed large amounts of information in a uniform way seemed to bring out the worst in those pupils, whereas lessons that developed programming skills in a practical way, saw far greater engagement from them. In this section I have outlined some teaching strategies designed to facilitate these greater levels of engagement from students with dyslexia. 

#### Overlearning

A convincing amount of research data has been published that associates dyslexia with a deficit in short term memory  that is likely to be related to the poor phonological processes as discussed above. The practice of providing students with multiple opportunities of overlearning is particularly helpful for dyslexic children. Driskell *et al.*, (1992) showed that, if a cognitive task was overlearnt for at least the length of time it had taken to learn initially, long term retention is greatly enhanced. This process can be optimised by leaving approximately a three week gap between the initial learning and the overlearning. Of particular interest in relation to the study of dyslexia, the researchers uncovered another fascinating finding quite separate from the effects of overlearning. They found that the speed at which learning was forgotten was unrelated to how long the initial learning process had taken. The problems dyslexic students have with memory would seem to be confined to the short-term or working memory only. An approach that encourages those students to employ an iterative process of revisiting previously acquired knowledge, and building new learning onto that, would appear to be particularly beneficial to them but also beneficial for all students.

#### Metacognition

As Eide & Eide (2012) and West (1997) argue in their books, many of the difficulties faced by children with dyslexia can be traced back to a lack of understanding of their unusual learning style. The theory suggests that weaker phonological and auditory skills are compensated for by stronger visual skills and enhanced holistic thinking. When looking at how this may help students learn computer programming Powell *et al.*(2004) found that:

*"The evidence here suggests that dyslexic students bring to programming their visualization and creative
problem solving skills"* .

A lack of awareness of these differences can be found among educators, but also among dyslexic children themselves. Training in metacognition or "thinking about thinking" can help children with dyslexia to improve awareness of their learning process and develop strategies to play to the strengths of their condition. This in turn helps to promote engagement in the classroom as they become more optimistic and resilient learners. One effective intervention would be to encourage the setting of personal goals to help the student to map prior knowledge and link it to the overall learning objective. This approach encourages dyslexic students to self-regulate their learning and best apply their working memory. Another intervention would be to utilise multi-model teaching by using a repertoire of methods for presenting information involving a mix of verbal, visual and practical approaches. Deploying this type of teaching will help all of the students in the class to develop their own metacognitive awareness too, as they recognise the learning style that best suits them as individuals.

#### Assistive technologies

Rello & Baeza-Yates (2013) found that dyslexic students have a clear preference for natural, clear and unfussy fonts finding that Helvetica, Courier, Arial and Verdana were the the best choices. The font used has implications beyond being purely a subjective preference for they also confer improvements in reading performance. The colours chosen for the font and background are important as well; strongly coloured or patterned backgrounds are not helpful for dyslexics. 

Turning our focus to the computing classroom, modern code development environments do contain a number of features of particular help to students with dyslexia, such as auto-completion of coding constructs and predictive completion of variable and function names. All these innovations are low cost and, with a little awareness of their importance, easy to implement in the classroom. Utilising existing built-in assistive technologies is the low hanging fruit amongst strategies to help dyslexic students and should be part of every teacher's tool kit. 

Many of the same principles can be applied to the lesson planning. It is helpful to use consistent layouts and avoid distractions, such as hyperlinks, within the text itself to help reduce the cognitive load on working memory. Most importantly teachers should use clear, concise language with graphical cues where appropriate. Pupils with dyslexia will particularly benefit from having information front-loaded so they can establish as much context setting as possible in advance of the lesson to provide an orientation that will help them pick-up and follow the overall thread (Lynch, 2013). 

#### Visualisations

The boon to teaching code that visualisation can confer has a long and respected lineage in the literature. Seymour Papert’s book Mindstorms (1980), introduced Logo, an educational programming language that is most commonly known for turtle graphics, with which line drawings could be created on the screen. Logo had the desired affect of offering a new approach to teaching and learning. The designers of the modern educational language, Scratch, describe themselves as deeply influenced by Papert and also by Alan Kay who worked on the Smalltalk programming language (Resnick *et al.*,2009). 

The important point here is that both Smalltalk and Scratch present small, well-defined notional machines that help novice programmers to flourish. A notional machine can be thought of as an idealised computer, the proprieties of which are defined by the programming language. By employing this teaching strategy the visual elements of Smalltalk and Scratch can be used to support understanding of the respective notional machines and, in my opinion, this accounts for the success of both languages. 

Scratch tends to make way for a text based language like Python or C at key stage three. However, it is my belief that clear visualisations can be effectively employed with these languages as well.

## Teaching 

I have planned a series of lessons to apply some of the strategies described above, I go on to describe how I would assess the impact of the lessons on my pupils, particular those with dyslexia. The lesson plans for this series of lessons form appendix 1. 

Speaking at the Conference on Dyslexia and Innovation in San Francisco in 2014, Dr. Brock Eide describes how the traditional approach to teaching treats the developing mind rather like a piggy bank, into which we deposit coins of information and then test the fidelity of that information when it is returned to us at a later date. The mind as a warehouse for the accurate and precise storing of information, for quick retention, will never be the best way to conceptualise the dyslexic mind. Dyslexic minds are much more like design studios; adept at seeing large scale patterns and able to recombine information in new and different ways to produce alternative answers. 

The philosophy underpinning my planning of a series of lesson centres around three key concepts that I think will benefit every student and, moreover, play to the strengths of the dyslexic mind. 

#### Practical work

We have a great advantage in computer science because one great indicator of learning is working code running on pupils’ machines. A key component of all the lessons planned is allowing a significant amount of the time for the practical completion of coding challenges to underpin the coding concepts being taught.

#### Holistic teaching 

People with dyslexia are often good at processing the entirety of the information related to a topic. So my approach to topic selection is to favour deep complete silos of information over broader more swallow coverage.

#### Visual learning

We all have access to a mind's eye that we can use to help us visualise solutions to problems, Bacon *et al.* (2007) were able to demonstrate that people with dyslexia are significantly inclined to favour a visual-spacial strategy for reasoning. The concepts being taught in this series of lessons that I have planned are always accompanied by visual-spacial cues as demonstrated by the sample slides I have included as appendix 2. 

###### Lesson one: Characters

To exemplify my preference for holistic teaching, the topic of 'characters' will be presented with the ASCII table and binary encoding as a single topic. As evidence of the effectiveness of this approach I would expect to see some students able exploit how characters are encoded when designing their algorithms. 

Take as an example the second activity in this lesson, which is about converting between lower and upper case letters. The ASCII representation of a letter's case in expressed by a single bit (bit 6) in the byte used to represent the letter. I would be encouraging insightful students to see how exploiting that fundamental feature of the ASCII table can enhance the elegance and reliability of their algorithm. 

###### Lesson two: Strings

This topic has a significant overlap with lesson one and I will make apparent the links between the two to encourage students to apply new learning to previous knowledge. 

The switch from single characters to strings of characters requires thinking in a new dimension. Subsequent lessons in this series will add further dimensions when arrays of strings are introduced.  Computer programming often involves the construction of conceptual mental representations that need to be at multiple levels of abstraction, what Dijkstra called the *'mental zoom lens'* required by programmers (Dijkstra, 1974). By being totally explicit about this process when teaching this topic, I expect to help students with dyslexia to appreciate and develop their strengths at this type reasoning for which their thinking style is particularly well suited. 

###### Lesson three: Arrays

The array data structure will be introduced for a second time, but in a new context. Whereas in a previous series of lessons students would have used integer arrays, in this case we are using character arrays. The time gap between the learning is designed to optimise overlearning to promote long-term retention. 

###### Lesson Four: David Bowie and 2 Dimensional Arrays

The theory suggests some students' learning styles will be much more suited toward processing visual memories. There are few more striking visual images than David Bowie's 1973 live performance of Moonage Daydream, with which this lesson starts. The hook is that Bowie contributed to a computer program to randomly return lines of lyrics and the main activity of this lesson is to use 2 dimensional arrays to reproduce a similar programme.

## Conclusion

*"As a 'hidden' disability, dyslexia can often be mistaken for a lack of awareness or ability, but in reality, the dyslexic individual merely has an alternative means of negotiating the world that deviates from the societal norm."*

(Stienen-Durand & George, 2014)

From my review of the literature on dyslexia I concluded that this quote, although helpful, perhaps misses an important point; those alternative means of negotiating the word confer certain advantages. The evidence, very strongly, suggests that the condition has a genetic root and that it has existed in the population for a significant period of time. It is quite possible that in preliterate times the special abilities that some people with dyslexia displayed would have been apparent without any of negative connotations. However in more recent times the type of information processing that prizes accuracy, precision and speed has come to be paramount, bringing into sharp relief the difficulties some individuals have with this mode of thinking. 

Substantial numbers of individuals with dyslexia have never been diagnosed as having the condition and they don't receive an education that either remediates their challenges or helps to nurture and develop their talents. It would be surprising to me if such a situation failed to result in pupil disengagement as a consequence. Imaging what's it's like to be repeatedly asked to focus on what you can't do well rather then what you can? 

My investigations have found several teaching strategies that can help students with dyslexia to flourish in the computing classroom. Promoting these strategies can help establish a more balanced and positive view of dyslexia, not just for the benefit of individuals affected by the condition but because the creative problem solving skills nurtured are just the type of skills we need to face to challenges of the future.
