# Can teaching strategies help dyslexic children learn computer programming?

## Introduction

People with dyslexia are over represented in the field of software engineering (Stein, 2018). There is a growing body of evidence that they excel at creative problem solving and at being able to visualise complex systems holistically. It would seem that software development is a field in which dyslexia confers advantages that override the problems dyslexics commonly have with reading, spelling and short term memory. However these advantages came fully to-the-fore at the system level and are not particularly useful when writing small, simple code fragments. Unfortunately these type of code fragments form the bedrock of how computer programming is taught in secondary schools today. I propose that by augmenting computer code with block and flow diagrams it may tap into dyslexic children's innate capacity for visualisation.

## Why Dyslexic brains are different 

Most people have some idea what it means to be dyslexic, they are aware that it affects some famous successful people and that it can confer difficulties with reading, spelling and writing whereby letters and numbers are jumbled and misrepresented, such as confusing the number 9 with the letter P.  It is sometimes referred to as word blindness, this is dyslexia as defined by its symptoms. Over the last thirty years or so the prevailing view has been established that these symptoms were due to deficiencies in processing phonics. Phonics are a set of forty-five or so sounds that patterns of letters make to produce the English language. Just as the letters themselves make up the alphabet, the phonics they produce make up all the sounds required for language. Problems with encoding word sounds to letters would make writing and spelling more challenging; similar difficulties decoding the sounds that letter patterns make would render reading harder. This probably goes some way to explaining the nature of dyslexia. Phonological problems occur at such a fundamental level you would expect them to affect higher level functions as well, and the traits dyslexics display, of jumbling sentences and inaccurate grammar, would seem to illustrate this theory too. However, other characteristics commonly found in people with dyslexia do not have a ready mapping onto phonological processing. Dyslexic people often have trouble with finger coordination, which expresses itself as difficulties with handwriting, and Eden et al. (1994) have shown the many dyslexics lack eye movement control whe but actaully represet a sensible trachin techiuew inselfn reading.

These skills are motor skills which are controlled by the cerebellum, a small structure to the back and bottom of the brain densely packed with neurons. Nicolson et al. (2001) proposed that dyslexia could be caused by dysfunction in cerebellar performance which is then manifested in problems developing both phonological and motor skills. The cerebellum has been traditionally understood to be important for learning and retaining automatic tasks, such as knitting, and Nicolson et al. were able to correlate impairment in acquiring automatic and procedural type skills with people who were dyslexic.

The debate sparked by these findings coalesced around the ideas that literacy skills may well require the co-ordination of several areas of the brain, particularly those concerned with motor, visual and cognitive activities. A clear understanding of the causes of dyslexia has the potential to confer insight into the functioning of the brain far beyond the condition itself, and it remains a field of active research. 

It is not the case, however, that all people with dyslexia also have impaired procedural learning so a deeper, more fundamental, understanding of how the brain processes information would seem to be required. In 1981 Dr. Roger Sperry won the Nobel prize for his work identifying that the brain's left and right hemispheres each had different specialities. The idea that the left hemisphere is used for close focus and fine detail processing whilst the right hemisphere handles the overview has entered the common discourse. This type of shorthand oversimplification is not always helpful but the development of functional magnetic resonance imaging a decade later allowed scientists to prove that people with dyslexia do significantly favour the right hemisphere when reading. Mark Jung-Beeman was able to explore further and he concluded that language is processed mostly in the left hemisphere but that when comprehension of complex language constructs, such as metaphor, is required the right hemisphere plays an important role (Jung-Beeman, 2005). Further work by Turkeltaub el al. (2003) established that all novice readers utilise both sides of the brain, with the majority becoming increasingly reliant on the left hemisphere as their skill developed. Dyslexic people, however, struggle to make this switch and this could explain why their deficiencies in literacy are often accompanied with enhanced skills typically associated with the right hemisphere thinking such as inventiveness, inferential reasoning and multidimensional thinking (Davis & Braun, 2011). **Bit more here about TG West on visual intelligence and more about Davis & Braun\Eide& Eide on why using the right side is good**  This theory leaves unanswered one important question; why do dyslexics who have effectively overcome their condition to function at a level of literacy skill commensurate with their potential continue to read more slowly and need to regularly reaffirm the correct spelling of certain words as they write?  **Or perhaps here**

The eminent neurologist Dr Manuel F. Casanova has suggested that the arrangement of neurons in the cortex of the brain could explain the differences in dyslexic brains and, fascinatingly, also those of people with autism. The cortex is thin layer of cells that covers the whole of the brain; within the cortex were found columns of neurons clustered together called minicolumns. Minicolumns are responsible for particular elements of information processing and groups of minicolumns are interconnected via axons to collectively perform higher level processing functions. What Dr Casanova found was that the spacing between the minicolumns in the cortex varies between individuals, with the distribution forming a bell curve. He found a correlation to dyslexia at one end of the distribution, and to autism at the other (Williams & Casanova, 2010).

At the tightly packed end, seen in people with autism, connections between the minicolumns are short and therefore effective at performing specialised fine-detail processing and quickly recognising small differences within a flow of information. The other end of the scale, where we find the longer connections between the minicolumns, correlated with the broad, holistic, big picture thinking style that dyslexics intuitively employ. Dr Casanova underlines the ramifications of his findings by linking them to where we started the discussion in this section, saying that more widely spaced minicolumns could account for the deficit in phonological coding that is the most prevalent symptom of dyslexia.

### Strategies to help dyslexic students to make progress in the computing classroom.

#### Overlearning

Having become acquainted with the current theory on the causes and effects of dyslexia the all important question of how this information can be reflected in classroom practice comes to the fore. A convincing amount of research data has been published that associates dyslexia with a deficit in short term memory  that is likely to be related to the poor phonological processes we have discussed. The practice of providing students with multiple opportunities of overlearning is particularly helpful for dyslexic children. Driskell *et al.*, (1992) showed that if a cognitive task was overlearnt for at least the length of time it had taken to learn initially than long term retention is greatly enhanced. This process can be optimised by leaving approximately a three week gap between the initial learning and the overlearning. These findings apply to all students but, interestingly from the dyslexic student standpoint, the researchers also found that the speed at which learning dissipated was unrelated to how long the initial learning process had taken. The problems dyslexic students have with memory would seem to be confined to the short-term or working memory only and an approach that encourages those students to employ an iterative process of revisiting previously acquired knowledge and building on it would appear to be particularly beneficial. 

#### Meta-cognition



Compartmentalisation 

Visual Thinking

## How visualisation helps

#### Logo, Smalltalk and Scratch

The boon to teaching code that visualisation can infer has a long and respected lineage in the literature. Seymour Papert’s book Mindstorms (1980), introduced Logo, an educational programming language that is most commonly know for turtle graphics, with which line drawings could be created on the screen. Logo had the desired affect of offering a new approach to teaching and learning. Papert’s great insight was that people learn best by making things to show to other people. The designers of the modern educational language, Scratch, describe themselves as deeply influenced by Papert and also by Alan Kay who worked on the Smalltalk programming language (Resnick et al. 2009). Smalltalk was envisaged as a bridge between the models held in the human mind the models of how the computer hardware actually worked. Moreover, the language had a user interface that was deliberately designed to be conducive to the way humans communicated naturally.

These philosophies can be seen reflected in Scratch, where not only are the artefacts produced normally visual in nature but the language itself is a visual interface containing movable blocks that can be dragged, dropped and snapped together to form programs. Resnick et al. (2009) show how Scratch is powerful tool for achieving programming tasks that would be much more difficult in a textual language. They have successfully demonstrates that even young novice programmers with little training are able to produce working programmes, developing their problem solving, design and development skills in the process.

## Conclusion

Dyslexia effects at least 7.5% of the population  (Shaywitz, at al. 1990) and if viewed from an alternative perspective could be categorised as less of a disabliltiy and more as an alternative way of negotiation the world. Prof. John Stein of Magdalen College, Oxford (2018), suggests that given that the differences in brain function have a genetic root, to survive the process of natural selection, they must confer an advantage to our spices.

## Appendix 

# Don't Know let

We all have access to a *minds eye* that we can use to help us visualise solutions to problems, especially problems of a deductive nature. Researchers in the field use *three-term series* problems to examine this capacity, an example of such is: 

Anne is taller than Siva.

Grace is shorter than Siva.

Who is the tallest? 

It has been proposed that reasoners sketch out a visual model in their minds eye and then reference this image to retrieve the answer. Knauff & Johnson-Laird (2002) concurred that reasoning is facilitated by this process, but they developed the nuance that there exists both visual and spacial expects to the model used. They were able to prove that if the visual element was obfuscating to the spacial it actually impeded reasoning. For example if the three-term information was given like this:

The cat is fatter than the ape.

The ape is fatter than the dog.

Who is fattest? 

Because reasoners first have to resolve the problem of comparing fatness between different species, it reliably takes them longer to reach an accurate conclusion. If relations like *above* or *below* are used in the three-term information, reasoners performed optimally. It is thought that this is because these concepts lend themselves to a spacial application and not a visual one. It would seem that visual information will help deduce relationship between entities, but only if the mental images created yield information that is relevant and accurate to the actual inference. 

Further research has revealed that there are two broad strategies, employed by people, to help the reasoning process. Either a verbal strategy is favoured or a visual-spatial one (Bacon et al., 2003). Even though the conclusions drawn may be identical and process appears ubiquitous the underlying approach to the reasoning is quite different.  

Von Karolyi et al. (2003)  found evidence that people with dyslexia prefer to represent and manipulate entities in a visual-spatial rather than verbal way. They can develop the talent to apply this skill to the entirety of the information related to a topic, globally. In other words, dyslexics would seem to have an innate talent for reasoning both visual-spatially and holistically. Bacon et al. (2007) were able pull a lot this theory together by being able to demonstrate that people with dyslexia were significantly inclined to favour the visual-spacial strategy for reasoning. Moreover, they the also able to confirm that the addition of irrelevant imagery will have a detrimental effect on the visual-spacial thinkers, the majority of whom will be dyslexic, whilst the verbal reasoners remained unaffected by it 

Reasoning is fundamental to understanding the world in general, of course, but in the narrower context of computer programming it sits right at the heart of the subject. The ability to accurately trace the values of variables as computer code is executed, line by line, is absolutely essential. The type of logic we have been discussing; if all A's are B's and all B's are C's, therefore all A's are C's, is closely related to selective constructs use in computer programming such is *if/then/else* and *case* statements which can be used in series to affect outcomes based on logic cases.  

Computer programming involves the construction of conceptual mental representations of the basic operations such as variables, loops and conditional statements into a schema to perform the task in hand. These conceptual mental representations need to work at multiple levels of abstraction, what Dijkstra called the *'mental zoom lens'* required by programmers (Dijkstra, 1974), so that high level constructs like object-orientation or techniques such as recursion can be added to a programmers toolbox.

-----

(Rello & Baeza-Yates, 2013) found that dyslexic students have a clear preference for natural, clear and unfussy fonts finding that Helvetica, Courier, Arial and Verdana were the the best choices. The font used has implications beyond being purely a subjective preference for they do confer improvements in reading performance for people with dyslexia.
