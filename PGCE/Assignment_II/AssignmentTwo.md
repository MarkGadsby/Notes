# An investigation of pupil progress and assessment in computing

### Introduction

The statutory guidance on the national curriculum for computing programmes in England includes, as one of four main aims, ensuring that all pupils:

*"can analyse problems in computational terms, and have repeated  practical experience of writing computer programs in order to solve such problems*" (DFE, 2013).

These computer programs can range from short blocks of code used to illustrate single programming concepts or more substantial software that brings several concepts into play and gives the coder an opportunity to develop their personal style through self expression. It is this latter type of program, a complete programming project, that the student can take full ownership of and take pride in, that I have selected as an aspect of assessment for this assignment.

I am convinced that it is through programming computers that a deep understanding of the power and potential of computers can be achieved. It is an activity that can in-itself be highly motivating and rewarding for students. It is this practical element of computing that ties our subject to other creative subjects taught like art & design, design & technology and music. **It is recognised that developing a young persons critical judgement, imagination and intuition though the type of experimentation and perseverance that computer programming can instil will not only enhance an individuals chances of economic success but also contribute positively to their health, well-being and help them develop a positive relationship with their community (Newton, 2019).**  Computing has the advantage over the other subjects, in the creative sphere, in that it has been included in the English Baccalaureate. Regrettable, though it is, that the explicitly creative subjects are underappreciated, it remains the case that it may be through our subject of computer science that pupils are garnered a rare opportunity to express their hard won theoretical knowledge in the creative sphere. 

Besides being a fun and inspiring activity in-itself a programming project also acts as a vehicle to assess the progress of pupils towards the learning objectives of their course of study. In this case that is acquiring object-orientated programming skills and an appreciation of how these skills reflect the theory of object-orientation. Programming with objects enables students to envisage entities that share common abstractions and introduces a new dimension for them to engage in computational problem solving. Evidence of this skill, as expressed in the programming project, is my key bench mark of pupil progress in this context. 

### Assessment approach

Assessment is widely understood to the be a vital tool that helps to measure the divide between what is we believe to have been taught and the reality of what has been learnt. As Dylan Wiliam puts it,

*"..assessment is a central - perhaps even the central - process in education. At the very least, assessment is integral to effective instruction*"(Wiliam, 2010).

Programming projects give students the opportunity to apply higher level problem solving skills and demonstrate their ability to apply abstraction to a problem at a number of different levels. They help students to think about problems in a way that makes them suitable for a computer to help solve and express their creativity through programming. 

The cohort in question are a class of 22 first year A level students, the topic being taught is object-orientation and the computer language selected is Java. Java is a fully object-orientated language and is very popular in both commercial and academic environments. It has a level of platform independence, in that the compiled Java bytecode can be interpreted by any client that has a Java virtual machine installed. 

Rather than jumping straight into Java programming at the same time as introducing students to the entirely new programming paradigm of object-orientation, with the cognitive load that requires, the educational integrated development environment (IDE) called Greenfoot will be introduced first to ease the transition. Greenfoot give a means of controlling a complete graphical micro-environment, with standard Java code, without having to concern the programmer with advanced implementation details such as callback loops, graphical user interface detail or even a static main method. By programming in Greenfoot, students are able to apply the important concepts of object-orientation explicitly and visually in a way that makes concrete the abstract concepts involved. 

Successful applications of this approach can be found in the literature. Kouznetsova (2007) used the BlueJ IDE to develop a series of lessons to write an implementation of the card game Black Jack, reporting that even novice programmers were able to master the basics of object-orientation. This work was expanded upon a year later, this time using the Greenfoot IDE, with series of lab sessions that lead to the completion of a Greenfoot game called Going to the Moon, again with increased engagement with the programming project being a key finding (Gallant & Mahmoud, 2008).

Michael Kölling, the chief architect of Greenfoot, states that the two main design goals for Greenfoot are:

- From the student’s perspective, the goal is to make programming engaging, creative and satisfying.

- From the teacher’s perspective, the goal is for the environment to actively help in teaching important, universal programming concepts (Kölling, 2010).

The universal programming concepts mentioned in the second point, cover the fundamentals of object-orientated programming, which is a primary goal for this part of A level course, but not only that. All the concepts students may have learnt from procedural programming can be brought to bear in the detailed coding of individual methods. The Greenfoot interface in no way modifies the underlying Java implementation which means the mature and extensive on-line help for Java can be brought into play. It also means the learning can be directly applied to pure Java programming which is the next stage in the course of study.

The words 'curriculum' and 'career' share the same Latin root word 'currere', which means to run the course, until the race is finished. It is useful to think of the learning required to master a particular topic of study, such as object-orientation, as a journey or learning trajectory (Sarama & Clements 2011). To help monitor a students progression on this journey three key questions have been identified: 

- Where am I going?
- How am I going?
- Where to next? (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). 

The first question can be answered from the outset; completing your own Greenfoot game or simulation as an individual programming project. This goal can be further refined with the requirement to include attributes, methods, constructors, encapsulation and inheritance. The specific nature of project is left to the student to decide, with input from teachers, so that the appropriate level of complexity can be selected to suit an individuals coding experience and confidence. **It is by taking this approach that differentiation can be achieved and that the topics selected are authentic and interesting to students and give them all scope for creativity.** Having a goal that is clearly defined enables the feedback given to be targeted at the achievement of specific elements of the goal and facilitates a shared understanding, between the pupil and the teacher, of the success criteria. 

Students enjoy challenging programming projects, particularly when they reflect the concepts being taught in the classroom, even if they generate high levels of frustration. Research has show that it is even the case that increased frustration can be associated with higher levels of engagement in projects (Hansen & Eddy, 2007) so educators can leave the kid-gloves off. However, very high levels of frustration can have a detrimental affect on engagement if students lack the confidence or access to help to overcome the challenges presented within a reasonable time-frame. 

The course of study involves short sessions of front of class teaching with the majority of lesson time being spent on the completion of a series of Greenfoot tutorials. Starting with those that are freely available from the Greenfoot website documentation page www.greenfoot.org and moving through three game tutorials, of increasing complexity,  the second of which is included as Appendix 5, as an example. These resources are essentially designed to answer the second question of how am I going? The tutorial series slowly introduces more advanced game playing features all within the context of an object-orientated framework. The majority of the tutorial completion will take place in the classroom and will therefore confer ample opportunities for feeding back information on progress, help with bug fixes and highlighting how game operations relate to the fundamental principles of object-orientation in a tangible and demonstrable way. By it's iterative nature, coding is an excellent vehicle for establishing how well you are going from the real-time feedback loop that is constructed by the process of compiling source code as it is written and the testing sub-routines as they are being developed.

The last question of, where the students learning will be directed next is clear. Following this section of the course the student will be introduced to pure Java programming using the NetBeans IDE exposing the student to some of complexities of object-oriented development in Java that are managed by the Greenfoot environment for this section of the course, see Appendix 6 for details.

### Planning

The lessons planned form a sequence of five which should be delivered in order. The structure of the teaching is that the first 30 minutes, of the allotted 90, should be spent reinforcing the key points from the last lesson and covering the current learning objectives by completing starter activities and discussing a short series of slides, which are included as Appendix 1. During the last hour of the lesson students spend the time completing the Greenfoot game tutorials and developing ideas for their own game. An entire weeks independent learning time, which is a minimum of four & half hours, will be allocated to the completion of the programming project. Whilst the lessons are being delivered, homework task are issued to compliment the topics covered during lesson time. 

#### Prior learning:

Pupils will have completed a course on procedural programming using the C programming language and will therefore by familiar with various data types (including arrays), sub-routines, loops and conditional statements as a minimum.

#### Lesson One: Introduction to Object Orientation

During this first lesson on this topic the key learning objective is to set-out where the new paradigm of object-orientation fits into the history of computer science and it's importance as a technique in modern software design. By the end of this lesson students should have started to understand the nature of an object and a class and have been introduced to encapsulation and abstraction by common behaviour. The homework task, to compliment this learning, is to complete the Isaac Computing object-orientation topic quiz.

#### Lesson Two: Construction and Encapsulation

The learning objective of this lesson is to bring into sharper focus the concept of a class by developing the idea that a class has a distinct name, attributes and methods. I also intend to introduce basic UML diagrams and and class constructor. By the end of the lesson pupils will be able to model a simple class in UML and start to see how a class can be represented and manipulated in code. The homework is to complete the definitions of object-orientate terms, that are included as Appendix 3. 

#### Lesson Three: Inheritance

The key learning objective of this lesson is to start to understand inheritance and the terms; sub-class, 		super-class, override, derive, ‘is kind of’ and polymorphism. The lesson starts with a recap on encapsulation and abstraction in the context of object-orientation. By the end of the lesson pupils will be able to produce UML classes in a hierarchy and start to see how inheritance and encapsulation are applied in their Greenfoot code. The homework is to watch and make notes on the craig'n'dave online resources: OCR A level SLR07 OO languages parts 1 to 4.

#### Lesson Four: Polymorphism

By the end of this lesson students should be improving their skill at class hierarchy modelling and their grasp of the object-orientation terms. The main objective is to recap on polymorphism and the use of object-orientation terms generally and to facilitate an understanding of how objects interrelate with each other.

#### Lesson Five: Greenfoot own project launch

The purpose of this lesson is to distil the programming concepts learnt from the Greenfoot tutorials and highlight how they are linked to the theory of object-orientation. This learning is then fed into the programming project itself as pupils decide on their games scope and outline design.

### Teaching 

Because object-orientation was being introduced as an entirely new topic, not just in the context of the A level course currently being taught but also for the cohort being taught. Questioning revealed that none of the students had encountered object-orientation at all during their prior learning. This meant that some theory and instruction was required, however the primary tool of delivery was to be the experience of exercising the new concepts in Greenfoot tutorials followed by assessment in the form of a programming project to write your own Greenfoot game. This meant that the teachers role was to act as a sounding board more 'guide by the side’ than ‘sage on the stage’.

The teaching resources included items designed to facilitate assessment for learning as the teaching unfolded, two examples of these are included as Appendix 3 and Appendix 4. I was careful to take into consideration the findings on the importance of providing a correct type of feedback to students, particularly the negative impact of giving the wrong types of feedback, such as giving marks as numerical scores or praise that related to the person rather than the learning achieved (James, 2004). Rather I used this data to correct any misunderstandings, gaps in comprehension or missing detail by adding comments via Microsoft Teams for individual students to reflect on. All of the information I was able to collate that related to that key question of how am I going? crucially fed into my lesson planning process. For example from the responses I received to the questions in Appendix 3 I conferred the need to adapt my teaching to correct some misconceptions of encapsulation and abstraction which directly fed into the first two slides of Lesson 3. 

For the practical element of the lessons, students were referred to the excellent Greenfoot API reference for details of the Actor and World classes, this reference has achieved the correct balance of including enough detail to be useful and yet succinct enough to be readily approachable. A good example for how the theory  and practice interrelate can be seen by the act() method that the Greenfoot Actor class implements and all children of that class override, thus presenting an excellent real world example of polymorphism.

When I was outlining the requirements for making their own Greenfoot game to my students, I was keen to demonstrate the flexibility of the Greenfoot platform. I have taken to heart a comment made by my tutor at Roehampton, Miles Berry, that he didn't issue challenges to his students he hadn't attempted himself. So I wrote a example Greenfoot simulation of the flocking behaviour that can be observed from the starling murmurations over the old Brighton pier, here is a screen shot:

![](/home/mark/Documents/Notes/PGCE/Assignment_II/GreenfootFlocking.png)

​											fig 1. A Greenfoot world scenario demonstrating flocking

I presented a slide briefly outlining how the semi-autonomous birds only need to factor in vector values for attraction, repulsion and alignment to achieve this effect. The goal of using a non-game related example, is to tap into research that shows that students find computer science engaging in-itself (Hansen & Eddy, 2007). I wanted to leave the door open to project ideas that bought into play broader computer science concepts like algorithms, searches and simulations into students topic consideration. 

### Evaluation 

I asserted in my introduction that students find programming rewarding and motivating and this has been born out by the evidence. Every single student took the challenge seriously, even those with a poor record of completing independent study tasks. The games were due-in the week after half-term and this was deliberate to give students the opportunity to spend extra time on the project. When reviewing the games delivered I could see that most students had taken advantage of this and I was pleased with all the work. With the best games I found myself distracted into playing for twenty minutes or so. 

![](/home/mark/Documents/Notes/PGCE/Assignment_II/Greenfoot_Patchwork.png)

​									fig 2. Some of the Greenfoot world scenarios created by students

In terms of manageability the sheer number of games produced made it impossible for me to review them all during lesson time in the detail required, so I implemented a peer review process where pairs of students reviewed each others games during the lesson and then I took the completed review forms (Appendix 2) and verified the findings outside of lesson time. Students were visibly keen to demonstrate their games to each other and the reviewers scored playability and fun as 4 or 5 across the broad (in fact one reviewer added an extra box for fun, indicating that it was off-the-scale). 

Core to my previous role, which was working in industry employed as a software engineer, was the job of getting software systems working or improving their performance. I can see parallels with my new chosen career as a teacher of computer science, for it is equally important to ensure that my pupils do make real progress and that we can measure it. 

That question of what is it we are measuring? is central to our successful evaluation. Extensive review of  textbooks and curricula has been completed (Tew & Guzdial, 2010). They compiled a list of common fundamental computer science concepts, which included the main heading of Object-Oriented Basics which is then further subdivided into:

- Object/Class
- Constructor
- Instance/Local Variable
- Accessor Methods
- Mutator Methods 
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism 

Kölling lists his findings that programming in Greenfoot can focus students minds specifically on how classes act as blueprints for objects, objects have the same attributes and methods but are individually unique, objects can communicate with each other via each others public methods and how data is passed between objects in the form of parameters (Kölling, 2010).

Researchers have studied the outcomes of students completing a similar practical Greenfoot programming course, in a camp setting in America, and found that participants had a stronger understanding of classes and objects (Al-Bow et al., 2008).

My study of the code submitted revealed that all the students were clear on most of these points, with the only areas of misconception remaining being around the more advanced features of inheritance and polymorphism which will be further explored during the next phase on the scheme-of-work which is pure Java programming. Given that the cohort were new to Greenfoot and object-orientation a month before I believe this is overwhelming evidence of real pupils progress being achieved.

### Conclusion

The experience I have gained running this programming project has only reinforced my belief that practical programming is the nub of computer science. I have been fortunate to have been working with a first year A level class, who will be completing a large formally assessed programming project in their second year of study. The topics chosen can vary widely and can be implemented in number of environments, including Greenfoot, so practical programming is very much included at key stage 5.

At key stage 4, however, the practical programming element remains unsatisfactory. In the 2017/18 academic year Ofqual abandoned the programming project, which hitherto had contributed 20% of the marks, mid-stream. This was largely due to malpractice and problems with moderation and administration. The situation persists were Ofqual insist on 20 hours of lesson time being dedicated to the project, despite it not being directly assessed.

Yet it remains the case that reading about how a bubble sort works is tedious whereas coding a bubble sort is rewarding. Of course differing levels of scaffolding will be required to render this task achievable to all, but the resulting 'wow' factor when the code runs correctly can generate a precious moment of clarity and understanding.

Peyton Jones & Oates (2018) layout a fascinating alternative akin to that applied to the assessment of the subject of science. They suggest that classroom time is dedicated to a series of practical tasks, each requiring the application of a computing principle, that is not assess in-itself but may then be referenced in the final written exam. As the authors put it: *"the weight of evidence should be the learning journey, rather than the paperwork"*.

As further evidence of the direction of travel, John Nixon of Ofsted, speaking at this years CAS summer conference, was clear that when scrutinising pupils' work during a school inspection, they did not expect to see everything written down and were happy to see completed project work on a shared drive or in a students on-line portfolio. 

The overriding theme I take from this assignment is that learning is journey and that it's this learning journey that should be paramount. Assessment should always be viewed in terms of how well it supports learning rather than how well learning supports assessment. To borrow a metaphor from Simon Peyton Jones, the assessment tail should not be allowed to wag the learning dog.
