# Love Letter Algorithm

### Computer Generated Love Letter.

```
Dearest Duck,
   My affectionate passion clings to your yearning. My anxious ardour attracts your curious desire. My loveable craving affectionately loves your fervour. You are my eager fellow feeling, my sympathetic appetite.
   Yours wistfully,
   M.U.C.

These letters themselves aren't particularly special. They wouldn't make your heart skip a beat if they were written to you, though they are kind of quaint. They actually have the feel of someone learning English doing their best but struggling with the right words! 

It's the way the algorithm works that was special. It uses simple rules that despite their simplicity gave it the power to write a vast number of different letters. 

It was based on lists of different kinds of words chosen to be suitable for love letters. There was a list of nouns (like 'affection', 'ardour', ...), a list of adjectives (like 'tender', 'loving', ...), and so on.

It then just chose words from the appropriate list at random and plugged them into place in template sentences, a bit like slotting pieces into a jigsaw. It only used a few kinds of sentences as its basic rules such as:  "You are my < adjective > < noun >".

The great rock star **David Bowie** co-wrote a computer program that generated lyric ideas. It gave him inspiration for some of his most famous songs. It generated sentences at random based on something called the **'cut-up'** technique: an algorithm for writing lyrics that he was already doing by hand. 

You take sentences from completely different places, cut them into bits and combine them in new ways. The randomness in the algorithm creates strange combinations of ideas and he would use ones that caught his attention, sometimes building whole songs around the ideas they expressed. An algorithm is the reason his song lyrics are so surreal!
