### Note from BHASVIC

You are always communicating what is acceptable. We are the policeman - I prefer ref.

------

- Use the phrase, ‘I need you to’, when giving instructions to individuals.
- Change the way you end the lesson and send students off.

## Paul’s Seven Habits for Effective Behaviour Management:

1. **Meet and greet at the door** - the best early intervention in behaviour management is at the door.

   'Good morning!'
   'Thanks for being on time.'
   'Uniform is looking good today, thank you!'
   'Hello, lovely day!'
   'Thanks for being on time, come on in.'

2. **Catch students doing the right thing** - nobody  wants insincere praise and it can be easy to catch children doing the  wrong thing so develop the ability to catch those more challenging  students doing the right thing.

3. **Deal with poor behaviour privately and calmly** - avoid as much as possible the public humiliation or public sanctioning of students

4. **Relentlessly build mutual trust** - the relationship you have with students sustains you and carries on into the future.

5. **Directly teach the behaviours and learning attitudes you want to see** - have a plan so that you know the behaviours you are trying to teach  and the students know what behaviours they are trying to learn.

6. **Talk about values** - never talk about behaviours  in isolation - always relate them back to the culture you are trying to  build and the values and truths you have as a class and as a teacher.

7. **Follow up follow up follow up** - teachers who  follow up are the ones the children decide to behave differently for.  Write it down if you have a difficult incident with a student, then you  have the control back - you can decide when and how to follow up.



## Watch out for

- **Displaying the rules on just one wall or in one place.** Think about where your routines are best displayed. A checklist of  rules for entering and leaving the room should be on the door.  Similarly, the routines for individual table activities need to be  visible to everyone as they work.
- **Enthusiastically introducing rituals and then not referring to them again** until sanctions need to be applied. Use the routines to support your  discussions with students. Refer to them tirelessly until they realise  that you are not going to be diverted from them.
- **Establishing too many new rituals too soon.**  Introduce new routines gradually and over time. Allow one or two to  become embedded before developing more advanced routines. Too many new  routines too soon are confusing for students and teachers.

## Reminder for Routine Writing

- Avoid use of ‘No’ and ‘Don’t’ - they have no positive impact on the routine
- Phrase routines positively
- Keep your checklist to a maximum of five and preferably limit to three
- Describe the behaviour that you need to see not the state of mind of the student

1. Routine for latecomers
2. Routine for individual work
3. Routine for practical work/experiments

```
'David, I notice you are gazing out of the window. 
The rule is that we stay on task. 
I need you to pick up your pen and begin the task.' 
(Then walk away giving the student time to take up your request.)

“Thank you Peta for tidying your stuff away so quickly and quietly!"
“I noticed how carefully you were listening there Leroy”

```

*“Well done for getting started on your work quickly, Adejola.”*

*“Good, you have paid attention to how to adjust the scale of your graph correctly, well done, Tracey.”*

*“Thanks for sitting in the correct seat sensibly, Philip, you are off to a good start today.”*

*“Great focused paired discussion work going on here between Kavita and Angelica – well done.”*

*“Great, I can see that Alex has worked out how to self-improve that paragraph – good job.”*

*“Two scientists working safely with chemicals here – that’s lovely - well done, Annabel and Ahmed.”*

*“This group are listening respectfully and attentively to one another’s ideas – great work Benjamin, Akua, and Matias.”*

This technique involves the following:

- Spotting the positive and desired micro-behaviours (walking around the room and listening-in usually helps)
- Describing these behaviours back using as much detail as possible
- Using the language of praise
- Using student’s names

Look at these examples:

- “Michele, after you have sat down in the correct seat, I need you to read the task quietly within the next three minutes”
- “Trevor and James, please ensure that both of your stools are  tucked in while handling chemicals, to help you to move around the room  more safely”
- “Sajida and Brian, I need you to keep your discussion focussed only on enzymes”
- “As you know Adriana, swearing is not allowed. I need you to address others much more respectfully from now on”
- “Jonathan, for this task, discussion is not permissible. I need  you to follow the instructions for getting help from the help-sheet  instead”
- “Vicky, can you take out from your bag the correct learning  apparatus only, and ensure that anything else not needed remains inside  your bag”

- Sincere, meaningful praise beats material reward every time
- Different students need reinforcement at different frequencies and intensities
- Learners need to understand what expectations are
- Learners should be encouraged to improve their own behaviour rather than compete with each other
- Everyone likes their parents to feel proud
- Systems should be consistent and fair

Favourite drive-bys:

- Offering the student a pen while speaking to another student who is sitting alongside
- Standing next to the student who is causing concern while speaking to the rest of the class
- Sitting next to a student while continuing other conversations
- Adjusting the student’s work while calmly reminding them of the first step in the task
- Giving simple non-verbal cues to remind the student of the expectations
- Showing acts of kindness - lend them a pencil, smile and see if  they are ok, hold the door open for them, ask if you may hang up their  coat

## The Three As

When you intervene in poor behaviour, think about the following…

### Audience

How might the audience affect the interaction? How could they be  affected by it? Consider moving to quieter space or having the  conversation away from the group.

### Acceleration

How can you stop the situation accelerating? Which deceleration techniques work with this student?

### Anger

How are you managing your anger and the anger/emotion of the student? Do you need to give the student time to calm down, time to think or  consider their next move?

# Ten reasons not to send them straight out

1. If you stray from the agreed hierarchy of sanctions you are  showing the children that you are inconsistent; you have broken your  agreement with the class.
2. Going for the highest sanction straight away leaves no further room for manoeuvre.
3. The child may react defensively – answering back, confronting, protesting publicly.
4. Colleagues find it difficult to gauge when you need support and when you are simply sending children out through frustration.
5. You allow the class to see your emotional reactions over your rational choices.
6. You are encouraging parents and senior staff to question your management of behaviour.
7. By sending children out you only relieve your frustration temporarily.
8. Other children will see your inconsistency and may protest or react against it.
9. For children who are often sent out without moving through the sanction steps, being excluded becomes an expected outcome.
10. Your behaviour management agreement with the class is trampled on. Trust is broken.



Examples of **diversions**

- ‘I need your help with….’
- ‘Do you remember…’

Examples of **diffusers**

- ‘I know this is difficult but…’
- ‘The comment was heard by everyone but we will deal with this after the lesson’



The script need be no more than 30 seconds and has 3 parts:

1. An opening line … ‘I notice that … ‘
2. The message delivered … ‘And you know that we need to … ‘
3. The consequence … ‘If you choose to … I will need to speak to you after the lesson … ‘



Key messages about intervention scripts:

- No judgement is ever made about the students identity during interventions.
- The relationship between teacher and student is paramount and must be protected.
- People are not their behaviour.
- Students must take responsibility for their behaviour and not have the opportunity to blame their adults for it.
- In 20 years your students will not remember much of what you taught them but they will remember how you treated them.
- Behaviours should be shifted to the past tense as soon as  possible.We are not interested in dwelling on poor choices but on  creating positive expectations for the rest of the lesson. Conversations are heavily weighted to what is going to happen next rather than what  has just happened.
- Presupposition is used to influence limiting self belief. When  unspoken positive assumptions lie behind your language they can affect  the student’s expectations of their own behaviour.  ‘I know that you  can…’ beats ‘Why oh why!’ every time.
- It is essential that scripts are complemented with skilled use of  physical language and a tone that is calm, kind and nurturing.  Any  script can be undermined by careless physical language or tone that  mixes the message.

## Examples of micro scripts used by experienced teachers working with challenging students

1. (Drop tone) I’m limited with what I can do here. You have left me  no choice in the matter. We have to follow procedure, this is the  situation.
2. I am happy to discuss this later but at the moment I have to get on with the lesson.
3. I’ve noticed that it’s not working. Come out of the classroom to  give you a chance to have some time away from the group. I shall come  out in a few minutes.
4. Jack you are not focusing on your work. The consequence of this is that I need you to move to the front so that you can work better.
5. You need to make the right decision now. You normally work well in this lesson.
6. I’ve seen how well you can work, that’s not happening today. I am  going to give you the opportunity to achieve the work you can do.
7. That may well be the case but I still need you to follow the instructions.
8. I have noticed that you have chosen not to make good choices. We  have now reached the point where if you continue to behave like this you can spend the rest of the day/lesson with a senior member of staff.
9. You can make the right decision and a senior member of staff can  take you to the hotspot where you can complete the work and return to me at the end of the lesson.
10. Altaf, do you understand why the situation has reached this point? Mr Turner is going to take you to the hotspot. I would like you to come and see me later as I know that you are a nice lad and I don’t know why you are behaving like this.

1. What has happened?
2. What were you thinking at the time? (teacher and student)
3. Who has been affected by the actions?
4. How have they been affected?
5. What needs to be done now to make things right?
6. How can we do things differently in the future?



# Ten reasons for following up incidents personally

1. The teacher best placed to have an impact on the behaviour of the student in their class is the class teacher.
2. Senior colleagues cannot control the behaviour of students remotely.
3. The student may come to the next lesson feeling resentment towards you if they have been passed up to another member of staff. You have no control over what happens and how that student is treated by others.
4. Inclusion is about building relationships with every learner regardless of their individual needs.
5. You have a responsibility to talk to the student about their  behaviour, repair trust and reinforce high expectations for the next  lesson.
6. If you pass responsibility to a senior colleague the student begins to imagine that you are not able to manage their behaviour.
7. You can use the opportunity to build your relationship with the student.
8. Many young people with chaotic home lives are testing whether the  adults around them are going to give up and pass them onto someone else.
9. You may discover information about the incident or background to it that will prove useful when managing the student in future.
10. Colleagues see that you are committed to managing the behaviour of all learners; when you ask for support it is more likely to be provided enthusiastically.



# They are no quick fix. Like everything in life it takes persistence  and practice on your part to make things happen and make things stick.

1. Focus on what you can control - your own behaviours - be calm and patient
2. Show positive high regard for ALL students regardless of previous behaviours
3. Shoot one rabbit at a time - simple rules and simple routines - less is more
4. Give classes your energy when you meet and greet - set the scene
5. Help students feel valued, appreciated and important by judicious honest praise
6. Use a recognition board to acknowledge behaviours above and beyond the norm
7. Use planned micro-scripts that help preserve the dignity of students and yourself
8. Keep calm when delivering negative consequences and always use take-up time
9. Utilise 5-step restorative conversations to re-set expectations and repair trust
10. Follow up every single time using praise, positive notes and postcards homee
