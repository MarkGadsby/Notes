Computational thinking is often sighted by computing educators as the prize gift the subject has to offer to the general secondary curriculum. It provides a framework of thinking that can be applied productively across subject boundaries, the argument flows. I am asserting that without computer programming, specifically, underpinning computational thinking what you are left with is an abstract framework for problem solving which looks suspiciously like just plain thinking. Notwithstanding that such a framework for problem solving has merit, compared to established evidence base scientific methods of problem solving its necessity appears questionable. I will argue that rather then computational thinking, it is computer programming that offers the key techniques that can be applied across the curriculum.
