### Define Computational Thinking:

In my opinion Computational thinking (CT) is being able to recognise the elements of a problem that can be most effectively solved by a computer. It is in essence how a software engineer utilises the tools available to create solutions.

The original definition used by Jennet Wing in 2006 is similar to mine but with more differentiation on what it is that solves the problem; she replaced 'computer' for 'computer—human or machine'. These words were further refined with input from Cuny, Snyder & Aho to 'information-processing agent' (Wing et al,2010), and here we arrive at the general definition cited over 5000 times in the literature.

Much work has been completed since (National Research Council, 2010; Barr and Stephenson, 2011) in the distilling out from this definition the key components of CT so that they might be better understood and ultimately taught effectively throughout the key stages of education.

The consensus is that CT is a thought process that involves abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, evaluation and generalization (Selby and Woollard, 2013).

Wing is much happier to untether her definition of CT from the computer than I am, for her CT is quite possible without a machine at all (Wing 2014) whereas for me is it essential.


### Outline why this has been incorporated into the English computing curriculum and exam specifications


### Debate critically whether this is justified

 - These three 500 words

### Identify some of the most important academic texts related to the teaching and assessment of computational thinking
 - Papert, Wing, Kemp

### Critically review these and relate them to the advice offered to secondary computing teachers
 - How robust is the research on computational thinking in school?
 - How coherent is the advice offered?
 - Are the recommendations offered to teachers based on evidence?

### Conclude this section by establishing an analytical framework that can be applied to an analysis of practice
 - These three 1000 words

One question is always obligatory: where do you get your information? In response, more and more people reach for their phones, open YouTube, Facebook or Twitter and show a tweet or meme that has reaffirmed their prejudices and added to all those northern Californian fortunes.

In 2017 Mark Zuckerberg said his company’s mission was to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together”. Even in an age of such rampant absurdity, that is surely among the most ridiculous things anyone has ever said.

*Autodidactic programming experience is not necessarily correlated with success in academic computer  science  studies.   These  students,  like  most  physics  students,  come  with  firmly  held  mental models that are not viable for academic studies.* - Strongly disagree

*Furthermore, the choice of language is not arbitrary (as is often claimed) because the “simplicity and visibility of the notional machine can be spoiled by poor languaged esign or implementation” (du Boulay, O’Shea, & Monk, 1989, p. 436*  - agree

*Advocates of an objects-first approach seem to be rejecting Piaget’s view that abstraction (or accommodation) follows assimilation.* - Piaget seems to get it.

*In Computer Science, the key processes focus uponcomputational thinking.  Computational thinking is the process of recognisingaspects of computation in the world that surrounds us, and applyingtools  and  techniques  from  computing  to  understand  and  reason  about  both natural and artificial systems and processes.*
