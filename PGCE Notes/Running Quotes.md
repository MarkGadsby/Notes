*Autodidactic programming experience is not necessarily correlated with success in academic computer  science  studies.   These  students,  like  most  physics  students,  come  with  firmly  held  mental models that are not viable for academic studies.* - Strongly disagree

*Furthermore, the choice of language is not arbitrary (as is often claimed) because the “simplicity and visibility of the notional machine can be spoiled by poor languaged esign or implementation” (du Boulay, O’Shea, & Monk, 1989, p. 436*  - agree

*Advocates of an objects-first approach seem to be rejecting Piaget’s view that abstraction (or accommodation) follows assimilation.* - Piaget seems to get it.
