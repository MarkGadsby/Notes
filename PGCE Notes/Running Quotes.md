One question is always obligatory: where do you get your information? In response, more and more people reach for their phones, open YouTube, Facebook or Twitter and show a tweet or meme that has reaffirmed their prejudices and added to all those northern Californian fortunes.

In 2017 Mark Zuckerberg said his company’s mission was to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together”. Even in an age of such rampant absurdity, that is surely among the most ridiculous things anyone has ever said.
